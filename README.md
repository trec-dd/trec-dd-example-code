# trec-dd-example-code

This is a code repository containing demos for the TREC Dynamic Domain track.
The primary purpose is to show how to read data out of the CBOR-format
data files.

To build the Java code, do
```
% mvn compile package
```
to build a .jar file.

To use the Python code, you will need to `pip install cbor` first.  The code has been tested with Python 2.7.10.
